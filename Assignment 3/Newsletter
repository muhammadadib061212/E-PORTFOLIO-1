Industry Visit (Biocon SDN. BHD.)
- pharmaceutical industry

📦🛠️Self Reflection🛠️📦
The visit to the industry at Biocon Sdn. Bhd. gave us more information on the uses of biotechnology and information systems within the pharmaceutical industry. Through this visit, we got a chance to learn the actual production process and observe how the strict regulations and standards are complied with in order to maintain quality.
This visit has opened our eyes as well to how computer systems, information security, data management, and machine performance monitoring relate to biotechnology. Consequently, by observation and firsthand experience of what goes on in a real-life working environment, we were able to effectively apply what we have learned at school where technology, research, and manufacturing come into play. On all counts, the visit has enhanced our level of preparedness for future tasks at work and narrowed down the gap between theory and practice.
